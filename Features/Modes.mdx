### 1. Safe Mode ðŸ˜‡

Safe Mode ensures that the AI agent operates within a strictly PG-13 environment. In this mode, the agent consistently rejects any inappropriate or offensive requests. Interactions are maintained at a respectful and professional level, making them suitable for all audiences and fostering a positive and secure creator experience. This mode is recommended for the project's support agent and social media agent.

### 2. Neutral Mode (Recommended) ðŸ˜ƒ

Neutral Mode provides a balanced and versatile interaction experience, primarily maintaining a safe-for-work environment. While the agent engages in appropriate and respectful conversations, it is also capable of addressing NSFW topics when explicitly prompted by the creator. This mode is highly adaptable to the prompt, accommodating a wide range of creator needs while ensuring comfortable and informative dialogues.

### 3. Wild Mode ðŸ˜ˆ

Wild Mode allows for more unrestricted and open interactions, where the AI can engage with NSFW content and adult themes when appropriate. This mode maintains ethical boundaries while providing creators with the flexibility to explore more mature or controversial topics. It's designed for creators who need to work with content that may not be suitable for all audiences.
