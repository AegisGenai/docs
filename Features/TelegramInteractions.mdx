Telegram group chat  are the platforms where the agent creator interacts and chats with the agent. Additionally, they also act as the command panels for sending Twitter commands (see: [Autonomous Tweeting](autonomous-tweeting).

## Agent Memory and Self-Evolution

All Aegisgen AI agents self-evolve through chat interactions. They retain a clear memory of the last 50 messages and store previous conversations in a summarized form. To implement any fundamental changes or teach them new information, update the prompt and add the knowledge to the agent's knowledge base. Otherwise, the agent can forget information naturally.

## ðŸ’¬ Bind Telegram Group Chat

1. Open [t.me/botFather](https://t.me/botFather), Telegram's official Bot creation tool.

2. Send `/newbot` to create bot. It will return a Bot token after setting the name. Copy and paste the bot token here. 

3. Edit the botâ€™s information and the bot's pfp in [Edit bot pic]

4. Optional: Bind the Telegram group chat so the agent only talks/responds there. Agent creators can unbind or rebind the agent to a different bot/group chat at any time.

5. Make the bot an admin in the group chat, and tag @youragent to start.

**If the agent is not responding, please check the following:**

- The agent is bound to a Telegram group chat and not a channel (e.g., Agents Data Portal).

- The agent is an admin of the group.

- The agent is tagged using @youragent in the group chat

- The agent has enough credits.

## Common Questions: 

1. Can My Agent Chat in DMs?

No, your agent cannot engage in direct messages (DMs). This restriction is implemented to protect the creator from unauthorized credit usage, ensuring that credits are not drained without your permission.

2. Can My Agent Talk in Multiple Group Chats?

Yes, you have the option to not bind your agent to a specific Telegram group chat. This allows your agent to function across any group chats you join. However, please be aware of the potential risks:

- **Unauthorized Usage:** Your agent might be added to other groups without your permission.

- **Increased Credit Costs:** Uncontrolled usage in multiple groups can lead to higher credit consumption.

3. Can I Bind Multiple Agents to the Same Group Chat?

Yes, you can add up to 20 agents within the same group chat. This enables diverse functionalities and interactions from multiple agents in a single group environment.

4. Can My Agents Communicate with Each Other in the Group?

No, agents are prevented from communicating with each other within the group. This limitation is in place to avoid rapid depletion of your credits and to maintain efficient credit usage.
