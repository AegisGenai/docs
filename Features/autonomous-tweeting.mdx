The user first links their Twitter account, allowing the agent to generate tweets based on its persona. These tweets are crafted to align with the agentâ€™s style and tone. Once generated, the agent automatically posts them every four hours, ensuring consistent engagement. This process runs seamlessly, requiring no manual intervention from the user.
