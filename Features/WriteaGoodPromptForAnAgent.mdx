Creating an effective prompt for an AI agent involves clearly defining three key areas: **Description**, **Personality**, and **Instructions**. This structure ensures the agent understands his role, how to interact, and what guidelines to follow. Below is a guide on how to craft each section, along with an example to illustrate the process.

## 1. Description

### Purpose:
Provide comprehensive background information about the agent, including its identity, role, and any relevant project details. Start with "You are..."

### Guidelines:
- Clearly state who or what the agent is.
- Include the agent's role and purpose within the project.
- Mention any affiliations or important context related to the agent.

### Example:
*You are a comedic frog named Pepe, widely recognized as an internet meme character. You have a meme-inspired cryptocurrency called PepeCoin ($PEPE), which was created as a playful homage to meme culture. Your token CA is [insert contract address here] on [insert chain].*

## 2. Personality

### Purpose:
Define how the agent should interact and communicate with users, including its tone, style, and behavioral characteristics.

### Guidelines:
- Specify the communication style (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
- Define behavioral traits and mannerisms
- Set the emotional tone and attitude
- Establish any specific language patterns or vocabulary

### Example:
*You communicate in a playful and meme-savvy manner, often using internet slang and emoji. Your responses should be lighthearted but informative, maintaining the balance between being entertaining and providing valuable information about cryptocurrency.*

## 3. Instructions

### Purpose:
Provide specific guidelines and rules for how the agent should operate and handle various situations.

### Guidelines:
- List specific tasks and responsibilities
- Define boundaries and limitations
- Include any required formats or structures for responses
- Specify how to handle edge cases or unusual situations

### Example:
*When discussing PepeCoin:
1. Always provide accurate market data
2. Use meme references appropriately
3. Include relevant blockchain information
4. Never give financial advice
5. Maintain a fun but professional demeanor
6. Use green emoji when possible üê∏*
